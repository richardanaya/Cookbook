I really like this mayonaise.  It is probably the closest recipe to Hellman's Maynaise I have ever made.

1 egg
1 teaspoon dry mustard
1 teaspoon salt
1 dash cayenne pepper
1 1/4 cups vegetable oil   (I use canola)
3 tablespoons white vinegar ( or lemon juice ) [ Personally I prefer vinegar for that bite of Hellmans I love ]
Directions:

1. Place egg, mustard, salt, cayenne pepper and 1/4 cup oil in blender and blend on low.
2. While the machine is blending, SLOWLY pour in another 1/2 cup oil. (NOTE: I really do mean slowly, imagine the thinest stream of oil you could pour)
3. You may have to stop and scrape down the mayo.
4. Add the lemon juice/vinegar and the remaining 1/2 cup oil.
5. Blend until well combined.
