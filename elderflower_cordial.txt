Elderflower Cordial

2 cups water
2 cups sugar
1/4 cup dried elderflowers (see note above)
1 Meyer lemon (see note above)
1 1/2 teaspoons citric acid powder (see note above)

1
Bring the water and sugar to a boil over medium heat until the sugar dissolves, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove from heat and let this simple syrup cool.

2
Wash and slice Meyer lemon and place in a sealable glass jar along with the elderflower and citric acid powder. Pour in cooled simple syrup, seal, and shake. Store in the refrigerator for a minimum of 24 hours (and up to 72 hours, if stronger flavor is desired).

3
Strain your cordial through cheesecloth into your desired container, pressing down to extract all the liquid. Store in a sealed glass container in the refrigerator for up to three months. (If you omit citric acid, store for no more than 3 weeks or until cordial appears cloudy. If you use vodka as a preservative in place of the citric acid, store for no more than six weeks or until cordial appears cloudy.)
